> **Cloud computing has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare and biomedical sciences, offering scalable, on-demand resources for managing vast amounts of data.** 

These words echo through the latest articles published in popular scientific databases, such as [Google Scholar][goog scholar] or [PubMed][Pubmed].  
Cloud computing has revolutionized many industries, but few have seen a transformation as profound as the field of **biomedical science and healthcare**. In a [recent review by Sachdeva et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e29044), the authors explore how cloud technologies are reshaping the way medical data is stored, analyzed, and protected.

## üß¨ Bioinformatics and Genomics in the Cloud

In the age of *big data*, genomics has become a central pillar of personalized medicine. Tools like [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi), [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/), and [DNAnexus](https://www.dnanexus.com/) allow researchers to store and analyze terabytes of genetic data directly in the cloud. This not only facilitates collaboration but also **eliminates the need for high-cost infrastructure** at individual research sites.

## üè• Cloud in Clinical and Radiological Practice

Cloud computing enables hospitals to deploy **electronic medical records (EMRs)**, imaging systems like **Cloud PACS**, and even **teleradiology**‚Äîallowing professionals to diagnose remotely. This is especially crucial in underserved areas where specialists are scarce.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Ahead

While cloud computing brings innovation, **some challenges remain**:

- Ensuring compliance with laws like *_HIPAA_* and *_GDPR_*
- Managing data across **hybrid cloud systems**
- Preventing data breaches, particularly in genomics and synthetic biology

The authors emphasize the need for *standardized guidelines and real-time risk monitoring* to ensure the long-term success of cloud-based biomedical infrastructures.

## üìò Conclusion

Cloud computing is *not just a technological upgrade*‚Äîit is a **paradigm shift** in how we approach healthcare and biomedical research. As we move toward a future defined by AI, IoT, and big data, cloud services will remain central to solving the world's most pressing medical challenges.
